By default pytest captures standard-output while running tests. Only if a test fails, the captured output is shown.

Meaning, if the test is a pass, the print stmts are not logged to console.

We can use -s option, toprint to stdout or to console in all cases.

pytest options:

--lf - last failed , run only last failed tests.
--ff - failed first, run failed tests first.
-v - for verbose output.
pytest --cache-show - to see the cache.
--stepwise - the test will run untill the first failure and then it stops.

python3 -m pytest -s ./tests/test_module01.py -k "test_a1 or test_a3" , to run two specific tests
